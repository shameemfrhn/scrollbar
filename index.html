        <h1>Global Warming</h1>
        <p>
          Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average
          surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the release of
          greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This phenomenon has significant
          environmental and societal impacts.
        </p>
        <p>Key points about global warming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Greenhouse Effect:</strong> The Earth's atmosphere naturally
            contains greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
            and water vapor. These gases trap heat from the sun and keep the
            planet warm enough to sustain life. However, human activities, such
            as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased the
            concentration of these gases, intensifying the greenhouse effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Over the past century, the
            Earth's average temperature has risen significantly. This rise in
            temperature leads to various consequences, including more frequent
            and severe heatwaves, altered weather patterns, and the melting of
            polar ice caps and glaciers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sea-Level Rise:</strong> As temperatures rise, ice sheets
            and glaciers melt, causing sea levels to rise. This poses a threat
            to coastal communities, increasing the risk of flooding and erosion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extreme Weather Events:</strong> Global warming is
            associated with an increase in extreme weather events, such as
            hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. These events can have
            devastating effects on ecosystems and human populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> The absorption of excess CO2
            by the oceans leads to ocean acidification. This harms marine life,
            including coral reefs and shellfish populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mitigation and Adaptation:</strong> Efforts to combat global
            warming include reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable
            energy adoption, afforestation, and sustainable practices.
            Additionally, societies must adapt to the changes that are already
            underway.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Global warming is a pressing global issue that requires collective
          action to mitigate its impacts and safeguard the planet for future
          generations.
